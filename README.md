# Javascript-Exercises
This repository has no particular objective, it is just a collection of exercises to improve my Javascript skills.

Each exercise has an associated folder, the folders are numbered indicating the order in which each mini-project was made. It is thus expected that the higher the number, the better development methodology was used.
